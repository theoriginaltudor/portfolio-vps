# Portfolio Website (Next.js App)

This is my personal portfolio site built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It features an AI-powered chat, project gallery, and a modern, responsive design. The site showcases my work, skills, and contact info, using Supabase for data and image storage.

## Folder Structure (nextjs-app)

- `app/` â€“ Next.js app directory (routing, pages, layouts)
- `components/` â€“ Reusable UI components (navigation, avatar, UI primitives)
- `feature-components/` â€“ Feature modules (chat, contact, work, carousels)
- `lib/` â€“ Utility functions and Supabase clients
- `public/` â€“ Static assets and images
- `types/` â€“ TypeScript types (database schema, swagger, etc.)

## Notable Functionality

- **Chat with AI**: Homepage chat box powered by Google Gemini (Vercel AI SDK), using retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions and link to relevant projects/articles.
- **Project Gallery**: `/work/project` and `/work/projects` display carousels of projects, each with images and skills. Clicking a project opens a detail page with more info, images, and related skills.
- **Contact**: `/contact` shows contact info and an avatar. Messages and errors are displayed contextually.
- **Supabase**: Used for storing project/article data, images, and (WIP) authentication.
