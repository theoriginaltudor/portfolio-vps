# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase. It features an AI-powered chat, a project gallery with carousels, and a modern, responsive design. The site showcases my projects, skills, and contact information, and uses Supabase for data and image storage.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/theoriginaltudor/portfolio-nextjs.git
   cd portfolio-nextjs
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```zsh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Supabase project keys:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```
4. **Run the development server:**
   ```zsh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view locally.


## Folder Structure

- `components/` â€“ General reusable UI components (navigation, avatar, UI primitives)
- `features/` â€“ Feature-specific modules (chat, contact, work description, carousels)
- `app/` â€“ Next.js app directory (routing, pages, layouts)
- `public/` â€“ Static assets and images
- `lib/` â€“ Utility functions and Supabase clients
- `types/` â€“ TypeScript types (database schema, etc.)

## Notable Functionality

- **Chat with AI**: The homepage features a chat box powered by Google Gemini via Vercel AI SDK. It uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions and link to relevant projects or articles.
- **Project Gallery**: `/project` displays a carousel of projects, each with images and skills. Clicking a project opens a detail page with more info, images, and related skills.
- **Contact**: `/contact` shows contact info and an avatar. Messages and errors are displayed contextually.
- **Supabase**: Used for storing project/article data, images, and (WIP) authentication.
